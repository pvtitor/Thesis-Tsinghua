### Development of a Machine Learning Algorithm to compare RAMS Standards Documents ###
=======================================================

This project contains the main codes implemented for my master thesis at Tsinghua University (Beijing).

This research aims to compare RAMS Standards Documents by using naturale languale processing tools, implementing lexical, semantic and syntactic features, and finally develop a machine learning classifier to train our model on the Microsoft Reseach Paraphrase Corpus.
